# Creating a Friday Night Funkin' Mod - Fundamentals

This guide is from the original FNF modding docs and will walk you through the process of creating a functioning, fully compatible Friday Night Funkin' mod, using the game's official systems for loading custom content and scripts. Once your mod is complete, you will be able to place it in the `mods` folder in your game install and use its content in-game without overriding the base game content and still maintain compatibility with other mods.

This chapter in particular goes through a lot of core concepts of modding in Funkin' that will get used in other guides, so be sure to read through it carefully.
